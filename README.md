# Port Scanner (Python)
 This is a script I have made to scan ports on any given host. even though there are much better tools like netcat and nmap, I wanted to know how their code works. and what better way to learn that to design one myself. :)

# Use Case
pip install pyfiglet  
  Python Port_Scanner.py "Host IP"
